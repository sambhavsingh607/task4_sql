# Classicmodels SQL Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries and analysis performed on the Classicmodels sample database. The objective of this project was to practice and demonstrate data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and advanced querying using MySQL on structured e-commerce sample data.

## Project Overview

The Classicmodels database simulates a realistic e-commerce business with tables such as customers, orders, products, payments, employees, and offices. This project involved:

- Exploring database structure and relationships
- Writing SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses
- Performing JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine tables
- Using aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT on grouped data
- Writing subqueries for complex data retrieval
- Creating views for reusable queries
- Query optimization with indexes

## Tech Stack

- MySQL 8.x
- MySQL Workbench for query execution and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install MySQL server and MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL client)
- Download and load the Classicmodels database  
  SQL script from [official source](https://gist.github.com/prof3ssorSt3v3/796ebc82fd8eeb0b697effaa1e86c3a6)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
3. Import and execute the provided SQL script (`classicmodels.sql`) to create and populate the database.
4. Open the included SQL query files and run them to see the results.

## Usage

The repository contains:

- SQL query scripts for different stages of data analysis.
- Screenshots of query outputs.
- Example queries demonstrating filtering, grouping, joining, subqueries, views, and indexing.

Open any `.sql` file in your MySQL client to explore or rerun queries.

## Results and Insights

- Summary of sales per product line and region.
- Customer purchase behaviors and payment analysis.
- Order fulfillment status and trends.
- Employee and office-related sales performance metrics.

## Future Work

- Implement more complex analytics like time series sales forecasting.
- Integrate visualization tools such as Power BI or Tableau for enhanced reporting.
- Develop automated scripts for regular database updates and report generation.
